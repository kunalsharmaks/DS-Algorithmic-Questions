# Algorithms and Data Structures

This is the collection of **Algorithms, Data Structures** and **Interview Questions** with solutions.
This repository contains my solutions for common algorithmic problems and implementation of Data Structures in C.
I've created this repository to learn about algorithms. I am adding solutions continuously. 


**Algorithms,  Data Structures** and **more than 400 Problems and Solutions** are provided so far.

## Problems:
  
### Arrays
1) [Reverse an Array](https://github.com/lakshaygoyal425/DS-Algorithmic-Questions/blob/main/Reverse%20Array.cpp)
2) [Find Max & Min number in Array](https://github.com/lakshaygoyal425/DS-Algorithmic-Questions/blob/main/Max%20Min%20in%20Array.cpp)
3) [Find Kth Max & Min number in Array](https://github.com/lakshaygoyal425/DS-Algorithmic-Questions/blob/main/Max%20Min%20kth%20in%20Array.cpp)
4) [Given an array which consists of only 0, 1 and 2. Sort the array without using any sorting algo]()
