# Algorithms and Data Structures

This is the collection of **Algorithms, Data Structures** and **Interview Questions** with solutions.
This repository contains my solutions for common algorithmic problems and implementation of Data Structures in C.
I've created this repository to learn about algorithms. I am adding solutions continuously. 


**Algorithms,  Data Structures** and **more than 400 Problems and Solutions** are provided so far.

## Problems:
  
### Arrays

## Level-1 (Easy)

1) [Reverse an Array](https://github.com/lakshaygoyal425/DS-Algorithmic-Questions/blob/main/Reverse%20Array.cpp)
2) [Find Max & Min number in Array](https://github.com/lakshaygoyal425/DS-Algorithmic-Questions/blob/main/Max%20Min%20in%20Array.cpp)
3) [Find Kth Max & Min number in Array](https://github.com/lakshaygoyal425/DS-Algorithmic-Questions/blob/main/Max%20Min%20kth%20in%20Array.cpp)
4) [Given an array which consists of only 0, 1 and 2. Sort the array without using any sorting algo](https://github.com/lakshaygoyal425/DS-Algorithmic-Questions/blob/main/Sort%20of%20an%20Array%200%2C1%2C2.cpp)
5) [Move all the negative elements to beginning of the array](https://github.com/lakshaygoyal425/DS-Algorithmic-Questions/blob/main/Move%20negative%20elements%20to%20beginning.cpp)
6) [Move all the negative elements to end of the array](https://github.com/lakshaygoyal425/DS-Algorithmic-Questions/blob/main/Move%20negative%20elements%20to%20end.cpp)
7) [Union and Intersection of Two Sorted Array](https://github.com/lakshaygoyal425/DS-Algorithmic-Questions/blob/main/Union%20and%20Intersection%20of%20two%20sorted%20array.cpp)
8) [Check if a key is present in every segment of size k in an array](https://github.com/lakshaygoyal425/DS-Algorithmic-Questions/blob/main/Key%20present%20in%20every%20segment.cpp)
9) [Occurrence of an integer in the array](https://github.com/lakshaygoyal425/DS-Algorithmic-Questions/blob/main/Occurence%20of%20an%20Integer%20in%20an%20Array.cpp)

## Level-2 (Medium)
1) [To cyclically rotate an array by one](https://github.com/lakshaygoyal425/DS-Algorithmic-Questions/blob/main/To%20cyclically%20rotate%20an%20array%20by%20one.cpp)
